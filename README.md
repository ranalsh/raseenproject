## "RASEEN" - Airport Airspace Monitoring System (Prototype for AVITHON)

This is a hackathon prototype for a radar-based AI system that detects and classifies aerial objects around an airport. The system focuses on identifying drones and birds, which are considered threats, and alerts the airport team through a dashboard interface.


## What It Does

- Displays moving aerial objects on a radar.
- Classifies them as Drone, Bird, or Safe.
- Shows visual alerts for threats.

  
This is a prototype. Radar and AI behavior are simulated due to time and hardware constraints.
